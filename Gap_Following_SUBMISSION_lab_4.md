**Discussion:** I was able to pass all obstacles. I had to lower the speed and change some parameters to do so, which is why the no obstacles' video is slow and curves very sharply. I am able to make that one go much faster with different parameters, but i submitted the code that performs best on the obstacles course, so i included the corresponding no obstacles video with that code.
